# Memory Game

This is fun game for the people of all age groups. Here you can test and sharpen your memory with different difficulty levels (**4x4** or **6x6**). This game can be played in very short time. You can enjoy this with your friends or as a solo player. This game can be a quick refreshment when you are bored, or over stressed for may be your work or for some other reason. In those situations this game can be a quick mind freshner. You can play this in your home, or your office (Make sure your boss does not see you playing though :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) either on your phone or laptop or any other device. You can choose the theme as simple **Numbers mode** or can make it more iconic with **Icons mode**.

## Overview

### How to play

Once you launch the application you will be landed on the **Start Page**. Choose the game Theme (**Select Theme**), how many of you want to play together (**Number of Players**) and difficulty level (**Grid Size**) and then click on **Start Game** to start the game. Now as the game is started you must be seeing the game screen with multiple cois. Total cois row and column number will be same as you had chose the grid size. All these cois are flipped down. Once you click any of the these, the same dot will be flipped back and you will be able to see the face of the dot where the corresponding number or the icon will be present. **Remember this icon or the number**. Only two coins can be openned simulteneously, unless its a **pair** (pair is a pair of coins which have the same icon or number). If two coins openned are not a pair then once the third coin is clicked other two coins will be flipped back and hide.
**Multiplayer Game**: You will get to open two coins in your turn, if its a pair then you will get chance to open another two coins. If not, the turn moved to the next player. At the end of the game the player with highest pair will win the game.
**Solo Game**: You have to find all the players and once its done based on the moves you have made and the time you have taken you can see your progress.
